## Overview:
Welcome to **Dreams World Properties**‚Äîa CRM application designed to handle client interactions and property-related requirements seamlessly! This application integrates **Salesforce** to optimize customer experience, streamline property management, and enhance real estate operations. The goal of this project is to automate client interactions, offer personalized property recommendations, and improve overall business efficiency through advanced CRM features.

## **Features:**
1. **Automated Customer Record Creation**:
   - When a customer engages with the website, the system automatically creates a record in **Salesforce**, capturing essential customer details such as name, contact information, preferences, and more.

2. **User Segmentation**:
   - Customers are categorized into **approved** or **non-approved** users based on predefined criteria. This segmentation helps in personalizing property offerings and recommendations.

3. **Tailored Property Recommendations**:
   - **Approved users** are presented with property listings that match their preferences and requirements, ensuring a more personalized experience. Non-approved users are shown broader listings to encourage further engagement.

4. **Seamless Salesforce Integration**:
   - The Salesforce CRM is integrated into the system to manage customer data, track interactions, and monitor sales activities in real-time, boosting operational efficiency.

5. **Enhanced Customer Engagement**:
   - By streamlining customer interactions through Salesforce, the application improves communication, enhances customer satisfaction, and supports long-term business growth in the competitive real estate market.

6. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - The system offers real-time updates on property availability, customer preferences, and changes in listings, ensuring both clients and agents are always up-to-date.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **Salesforce**: To manage customer data, automate processes, and handle customer relationships.
- **Apex Classes**: For customized logic and automation of property-related processes.
- **Visualforce Pages**: To create personalized and user-friendly web interfaces.
- **Salesforce APIs**: For seamless integration with external platforms and data sources.
- **Lightning Components**: To build interactive and modern UI components for the application.

## **How It Works**:
1. **User Engagement**: A potential customer interacts with the property website.
2. **Automated Record Creation**: As the user fills in their details (name, preferences, contact info), the Salesforce system automatically creates a record, capturing and categorizing the user.
3. **Property Matching**: Based on the approval status, the system filters and shows properties that best suit the client‚Äôs needs.
4. **Personalized Experience**: Approved users receive curated property suggestions tailored to their preferences, enhancing the overall user experience.

## **Benefits**:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Clients receive a highly personalized journey, making the property search more efficient and relevant.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated processes reduce manual work and speed up the response time.
- **Scalability**: The Salesforce platform allows the system to easily scale and accommodate a growing number of users and properties.
- **Better Client-Property Matching**: By segmenting users and tailoring recommendations, clients are more likely to find the right property quickly.
